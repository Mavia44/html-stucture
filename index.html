      Web development refers to the process of <i>creating</i> and maintaining websites
      on the <b>World Wide Web.</b> It involves various tasks such as web design,
      content development, client-side scripting, and server-side scripting. The
      goal is to build a functional and visually appealing website that can be
      accessed and interacted with through web browsers. App development, on the
      other hand, involves the creation of applications, commonly known as apps,
      for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. This process includes
      designing the user interface, developing the application's functionality,
      and optimizing it for the specific platform it is intended for. Mobile app
      development can be done for various operating systems, such as iOS and
      Android, using programming languages like Swift, Java, or Kotlin.
